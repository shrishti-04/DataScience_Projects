<H1>Movie Recommendation System</H1>

<H3>Recommendation System:</h3>
<p>A Recommendation System is an algorithm designed to suggest relevant items to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or interactions. <p>

<h4>Types of recommendation systems:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Collaborative Filtering:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>User-based:<b> Recommends items to a user by finding similar users and suggesting items they liked.
<li><b>Item-based:<b> Recommends items by finding similar items based on user interactions.</li>
<li>Example: Collaborative filtering would recommend movies based on the ratings and preferences of similar users.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
<li>Content-Based Filtering:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Recommends items by analyzing the features of the items and comparing them to a userâ€™s previous interactions or preferences.</li>
<li>Content-based filtering would recommend movies similar to those a user has liked, based on features such as genre, director, or cast.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This project implements a collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The recommendation engine uses user ratings to predict and suggest movies to users based on their preferences.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Data Loading and Preprocessing:<b> The dataset containing user ratings for movies is loaded and cleaned. The project also includes mapping movie IDs to their corresponding titles.</li>
<li><b>Collaborative Filtering:<b> The system uses user-based collaborative filtering to compute similarities between users and recommend movies they haven't rated.</li>
<li><b>Matrix Factorization:<b> The recommendation is built using matrix factorization techniques to improve prediction accuracy.</li></ul>
</p>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Python:<b> The project is implemented in Python using libraries like pandas and numpy for data manipulation.</li>
<li><b>Pandas:<b> Used for reading and processing the dataset.//</li>
<li><b>MovieLens Dataset:<b> The system works with user-movie rating data to build recommendations.</li></ul>
